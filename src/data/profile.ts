  aboutIntro:
    "I blend architectural thinking with machine intelligence to design interfaces that feel cinematic while staying grounded in resilient engineering.",
  about:
    "I'm a Computer Science major at Illinois Institute of Technology with a minor in Architecture. I love pairing poetic visuals with systems that can handle the pressure—whether that's fine-tuning AI copilots, guiding data-heavy experiences, or shipping health-tech prototypes. I've contributed to Radical AI, coached 200+ peers through IIT workshops, and earned recognition from Intel, AWS, and The GRAMMYs. I'm currently exploring internships and research in software, AI, data, and immersive product design.",
