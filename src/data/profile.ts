  about: "I'm a Computer Science major at the Illinois Institute of Technology with a minor in Architecture—blending logic with creativity to build tech that works and resonates. Experience across AI engineering, cloud, data analytics, and full-stack dev, with impact as a TA, tutor, and project team lead. I've contributed to AI solutions at Radical AI, built health-tech systems, and earned certifications from Intel, AWS, and The GRAMMYs. I teach Java/OOP and problem-solving, which keeps my fundamentals sharp. I'm actively seeking internship and research opportunities in software engineering, AI/ML, cloud, and data.",
